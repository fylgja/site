Fylgja is out of the box fully accessible.

We don't make color choices for you, and follow the principles of Typography.

All our click based elements fit in to the minimum 38 pixel size,
and most even have the recommended 44 pixel size.

If you use a Fylgja component with another framework,
make sure it also follows the accessibility rules.
Make sure you have configured it correctly.

Make sure your HTML is build the correct way, so your app or site is 
accessible for most users.
