Fylgja is out of the box fully accessible.

We don't make color choices for you.
And follow the right typography basis.

All our click bases elements fit in to the minimum 38 pixel size.
And most even have the recommended 44 pixel size.

If you use a Fylgja component with another framework.
Make sure the other framework also follows the accessibility rules.
Or make sure you have configured it correctly.

Basides that make sure your HTML is build in the correct way.
So your site is usable to most users, without adding accessible enhancements.
