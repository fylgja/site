Fylgja is out of the box fully accessible.

We don't make color choices for you, and follow the principles of typography.

All our click based elements fit in to the minimum 38 pixel size,
and most even have the recommended w3c 44 pixel size.

Besides that, a good HTML structure solves most accessibility issues.

That said, Fylgja also offers helpers that make it easier to build your site,
without compromising on style in favour of accessibility.
