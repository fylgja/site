Fylgja believes in clean html.

This done via single layered and purpose classes.
But it also ship's with many styles set directly on the html element,
a.k.a. Native Elements.

Some elements like form fields don't require different styles.
Than the one you use repeatedly trough the site.
Instead the flexibility is added via CSS variables.
If the style need to be different for that one use case.

Besides that there is nothing wrong with having the styles set directly.
as long it is a foundational style.

The main advantage of Native Elements is that your html does not need to have any classes.
To have good default.

Best samples of this are our form based components,
like `@fylgja/form` and `@fylgja/control`.

For more Native Elements [checkout out the Fylgja components](/components#nativeelements).
