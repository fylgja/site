So have you ever heard of minimal CSS frameworks that ship (almost) no CSS or that only apply CSS to HTML tags.
well this is know as [Native Elements](/features/native-styles/) or styleless CSS frameworks.

This approach can simplify your HTML dramatically and makes it easier for none frontend developers to get started without touching any CSS.

So you might ask how is this not a the same as a normalize or reset CSS, I would say no.

This more of a starting point or a common default, sure its opinionated but these days with CSS Components and CSS Props (variables) you can make it yours with a few lines if needed.

So why would you want this?

Using native elements allows you start building your site, blog or webapp without focusing on what classes to add, and if you do need to tweak something you can use.

## How to use

First make sure you a have project running in your favorite framework, like AstroJS, NextJS, Eleventy, etc..
