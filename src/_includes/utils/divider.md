Except you can set the class on parent element.

This class will give each child after another child a border per the value.

The following options/direction are available.

- `divider-x` = border-inline-start

> Each option is using the writing direction.
> in LTR `border-inline-start` is the same as `border-left`.

It also has the following options available:
