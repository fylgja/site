### Space

Space works similar to the margin y and x version,
Except you can set the class on parent element.

This class will give each child after another child spacing per the value.
Similar to the gap property.
Except this can also be used on elements that are not part of a grid or flex container.

The following options/direction are available.

- `space-y` = margin-block-start
- `space-x` = margin-inline-start

> Each option is using the writing direction.
> in LTR `margin-inline-start` is the same as `margin-left`.

It also has the following options available:
- Responsive classes
