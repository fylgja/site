	<h1>Getting Started</h1>
	<p>New to Fylgja and not sure where to begin?</p>
	<p>The most straightforward way to get started is by using Fylgja as your CSS foundation.</p>
	<p>
		While Fylgja is technically a library at its core, it's designed to function seamlessly as a
		CSS framework.
	</p>
	<p>
		There are several ways to integrate Fylgja into your project, but the easiest and most
		recommended approach is using the meta package.
	</p>

	<h2>Installation & Quick Start</h2>
	<p>Install the meta package using npm:</p>
	<Code lang="sh" code="npm install fylgja" />
	<p>This single command installs the following essential packages:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><code>@fylgja/base</code>: Provides a solid foundation of base styles.</li>
		<li><code>@fylgja/tokens</code>: Offers a set of design tokens for consistent styling.</li>
		<li>
			<code>@fylgja/utilities</code>: Includes a curated collection of helpful CSS utilities.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Once installed, you can import these packages into your project:</p>
	<Code
		lang="css"
		code=`@import "@fylgja/base";\n@import "@fylgja/tokens";\n@import "@fylgja/utilities";`
	/>

	<h2>Using Fylgja</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			<strong>Fylgja Base:</strong> The base styles are applied without the need to add specific
			classes, providing a consistent starting point for your project.
		</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Fylgja Tokens:</strong> You can inspect the available design tokens directly in your
			browser's developer tools to understand the styling variables available to you.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>
		For more in-depth information and details about each package, be sure to explore the
		comprehensive Fylgja Library documentation.
