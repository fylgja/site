Time to introduce Fylgja a new CSS framework, there are already a lot of CSS frameworks, almost everybody knows Bootstrap, Material and Tailwind.

None of them are bad, each of them does the job, and if one of them fits the way you are working, you're probably happy.

Looking around on dev.to you would find articles, describing CSS frameworks and their pros and cons.

So why! Fylgja, well because its a very good tool for frontenders who understand CSS and need a consistent basis for their projects.

Some history, years ago we started working with Bootstrap 2, using it for frontend design, we developed it as an extend / utility pack to give us tools to work better and faster.

Initially developed with LESS and Grunt we switched to SCSS and GULP, and it became a daily tool for us, [read the full story here](https://fylgja.dev/about).

On the road we learned from others and we continuously kept developing it to improve things, and since we are only human and are proud of our product we like to share it with you all.

We put it on Github and released version 1 on 22 June this year, you can find the Website with the documentation on Fylgja.dev

Of course, we could fill this article with exaggerating marketing text, telling you how good it is, and why we’re the best (we are 😁) but no BS here, Take a look, try it out, use it and contribute if you like.
