Fylgja believes in clean HTML. We achieve this through single-layered and purpose-driven classes. However, we also ship with many styles set directly on the HTML element, known as Native Elements.

Some elements, such as form fields, do not require different styles than the ones you use repeatedly throughout your site. Instead, we add flexibility through CSS variables, which allow you to change the style for a specific use case.

There is nothing wrong with having styles set directly on the HTML element, as long as they are foundational styles. The main advantage of Native Elements is that your HTML does not need to have any classes to have good defaults.

To see this in action, check out our CodePen using only HTML and nothing more: [https://codepen.io/Fylgja/pen/ExGOZaE]

Or try it yourself using one of our Native Element components below.
