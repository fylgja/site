For developers who love the utility-first workflow of Tailwind CSS but want to leverage Fylgja's thoughtful design system, we offer an official Tailwind preset.

This preset seamlessly replaces Tailwind's default theme with Fylgja's design tokens, including our color palette, shadows, and spacing. It also integrates Fylgja's base styles and custom utilities, giving you the best of both worlds.

It's the perfect way to combine the power of Tailwind's utility classes with the consistent and beautiful design foundation of Fylgja.

For detailed installation and usage instructions, please see the official documentation for the preset.
