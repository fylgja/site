At Fylgja, we believe in flexibility and freedom of choice. That's why one of our core concepts is being "buildless." This means you can start using Fylgja's CSS components and styles without needing any complex build tools or setup.

## What does "Buildless" mean?

Simply put, you can use Fylgja by just linking to the CSS file in your HTML. There's no mandatory requirement for ViteJs, Bun, or any other bundler. You can download the CSS files and host them yourself, or link directly to them from a CDN.

This approach offers several advantages:

*   **Simplicity:** Get started in seconds. Just add a `<link>` tag to your HTML, and you're ready to go.
*   **Perfect for Prototyping:** Ideal for quick demos, proof-of-concepts, or small projects where a build process would be overkill.
*   **Focus on Creativity:** Spend your time designing and building your page, not configuring tools.

## Does this mean I shouldn't use build tools?

Not at all! While Fylgja is proud to be buildless, we also embrace the power and efficiency that build tools offer for larger, more complex projects.

Using a build process with tools like PostCSS, Tailwind CSS (with our preset), or UnoCSS can unlock advanced features like:

*   **Purging unused styles:** Keep your final CSS bundle as small as possible.
*   **Customization:** Easily modify design tokens and component styles.
*   **Integrating with frameworks:** Seamlessly use Fylgja with frameworks like React, Vue, or Svelte.

The choice is yours. Fylgja is designed to fit your workflow, whether it's a simple HTML file or a sophisticated single-page application.
