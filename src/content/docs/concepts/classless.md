**Class-less CSS** allows you to write HTML without needing to add CSS classes manually.
Instead, styling is automatically applied to elements based on their HTML tags.

This provides a refined starting point, better than the default browser styles, and can be easily customized to suit your needs.

With [Fylgja Base], we offer a complete package for this approach.

## Benefits of Class-less CSS

The key advantage of using class-less CSS is that it’s flexible.

You’re not limited to predefined styles, and you can still apply your own custom CSS on top of it.

This allows for quicker setup while maintaining the ability to fine-tune your design.

## Why Choose Class-less Over Normalize or Reset?

Class-less CSS provides a more polished default styling,
so you can start designing immediately without having to build a foundation yourself. 

Take form fields, for example. On most sites, forms come with common default styles—borders, padding, etc.
Class-less CSS improves these defaults out of the box, while still allowing for further customization.

## Customization with Fylgja Base

If you want a different look, [Fylgja Base] makes it easy to adjust.

You can modify the provided CSS variables or apply your own styles directly.

Since Fylgja Base keeps CSS specificity low, you’ll have full control over customization without any hassle,
allowing it to act as a true foundation for your unique design.
