The badges component serves as a small blocks to indicate notifications, or to highlight an item.

## Installation

```bash
npm install @fylgja/badge
```

Then include the component in to your code via;

```scss
@use "@fylgja/badge";
// Or via PostCSS import
@import "@fylgja/badge";
```

## How to use

To use the badge, create element with the class `.badge`.

```html
<span class="badge">..</span>
```

But if you need a badge with a little more complexity,
like a badge with 2 sides of data or with a close button.

You can use the `.badge-addon` as wrapper that binds the 2 badges to one badge.

```html
<div class="badge-addon">
    <span class="badge">New</span>
    <button class="badge -theme">Close</button>
</div>
```

### Badge group (Tag cloud)

To create Badge group (Tag cloud), you need to use custom CSS or the `@fylgja/utilpack`.

To create a flex-grid with gap via margin or via the gap property (when it is better supported).

```html
<div class="flex flex-wrap">
    <span class="badge m-1">Wolfs</span>
    <span class="badge m-1">Cats</span>
    <span class="badge m-1">Bears</span>
    ...
</div>
```

## Config

As with almost all of our components, CSS variables can be configured to add your own look/style.

Want direct control on the base styles, here are the following SCSS variables can you modify.

```scss
$badge-padding: 0.125em 0.75em !default;
$badge-radius: 0.375em !default;
$badge-bg: if($root-fg == #000, #eee, #222) !default;
$badge-color: $color-text !default;
$badge-font-size: 0.75em !default;
$badge-font-weight: 500 !default;
```
